# Installation

## Conda

We support the installation via the conda package manager.

```shell
conda install -c i4ds -c conda-forge karabo-pipeline
```

With this one command you can use most of our package with no restrictions.
However, to use the imaging portion of it, you need to install rascil via pip aswell.

```shell
pip install --index-url=https://artefact.skao.int/repository/pypi-all/simple rascil
```
