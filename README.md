Karabo is the name of a software system that we ambitiously call a digital twin pipeline.
It reproduces in 
a simple way the path of sky observation data through processing modules that mimic conceptually
the pipeline of the
future [Square Kilometer Array](https://www.skatelescope.org/the-ska-project/).

It should serve as a tool to learn and possibly also benchmark some of the processing steps
from a sky simulation to the science products. 

Karabo is written in Python, composed of modules that can be 
set up in an interactive Jupyter Notebook environment.

Installation
------------

The software can be installed on a normal laptop, but you will need Windows or Linux. 
On a Mac, you will need to use the [Docker](https://i4ds.github.io/Karabo-Pipeline/container.html)
version.

Please see our [documentation](https://i4ds.github.io/Karabo-Pipeline/installation_user.html) 
for the full installation instructions.
