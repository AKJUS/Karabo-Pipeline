Karabo is the name of a software system that we ambitiously call a digital twin pipeline.
It reproduces in an accessible way the path of sky observation data through processing modules that mimic conceptually
the pipeline of the [Square Kilometer Array](https://www.skatelescope.org/the-ska-project/).

It should serve as a tool to learn and possibly also benchmark some of the processing steps
from a sky simulation to the science products. 

Karabo has multiple skies ready available for experimentation, such as 

- [MIGHTEE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05741)
- [GLEAM](https://www.mwatelescope.org/science/galactic-science/gleam/)

Karabo is written in Python, composed of modules that can be set up in an interactive Jupyter Notebook environment.

Installation
------------

The software can be installed on Linux, Windows or Windows WSL.
